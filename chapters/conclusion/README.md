# Conclusion
Thanks for making it to the end of the Little ASP.NET Core Book! There's a lot more that ASP.NET Core can do that didn't fit in this short book, including

* Building RESTful APIs and microservices
* Using ASP.NET Core with single-page apps like Angular and React
* Razor Pages
* Bundling and minifying static assets
* WebSockets

I write about many of these topics on my blog: https://www.recaffeinate.co

The official ASP.NET Core documentation also covers these topics, and more: https://docs.asp.net

Happy coding!
## About the author
Hey, I'm Nate! I wrote the Little ASP.NET Core Book in a caffeine-fueled weekend because I love ASP.NET Core and wanted to give back to the community. I hope it helped you learn something new, and I hope you build more apps with ASP.NET Core!

You can stay in touch with me on Twitter ([@nbarbettini](https://twitter.com/nbarbettini)) or on my blog (https://www.recaffeinate.co).
## Special thanks
To my wife, who puts up with my crazy ideas.
