# Introduction

Thanks for picking up the Little ASP.NET Core Book! I wrote this short book to help developers and people interested in web programming learn about ASP.NET Core, a new framework for building web applications and APIs.

The Little ASP.NET Core Book is structured as a tutorial. You'll work on one application from start to finish. You don't need to know anything about ASP.NET Core to get started.
